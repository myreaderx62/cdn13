Called DeepLens, the camera is intended for developers who want to learn to build applications that leverage Amazon's artificial intelligence technology.\nSEE ALSO: Boston Dynamics robot can now nail a backflip and land steadily on its feet\nThe camera is available for pre-order now and will ship next year, the company says.\nIt's a boxy device that's obviously designed with the AI tech in mind rather than looks or pure specs. The 4MP camera shoots 1080p HD video and is equipped with Wi-Fi, a micro SD slot, and 8 GB of memory. \nThe real reason developers will want the camera, of course, is for its AI tech. Built in are a set of pre-trained image recognition models that developers can use to create their own applications.\n\n\"These models will help you detect cats and dogs, faces, a wide array of household and everyday objects, motions and actions, and even hot dogs,\" Amazon's Jeff Barr writes in a blog post. \"We will continue to train these models, making them better and better over time.\"\nThat means a developer who wants to build an application for, say, detecting household objects, can get started without having to train a set of algorithms from scratch — a time-consuming and often expensive task.\nThis stands to greatly reduce the barrier to entry for developers who want to work with artificial intelligence technology but may not have the resources on their own.\nWATCH: The OnePlus 5T could have been perfect—if it weren't for its cameras"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F664105%252F59ea3d7a-4090-44a6-96d1-b8188e494209.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=TSTVyJOkBswbQ4lMvogWfGHq6W0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F63981%252F88e106e7-fc5c-467b-af94-832eb3567f78.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ztw9arSmKTsfzZq3rGhRmKDBwJY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F63981%252F88e106e7-fc5c-467b-af94-832eb3567f78.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZPv4iqhNGH-B2fotIQ5zh5Njqi4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F63981%252F88e106e7-fc5c-467b-af94-832eb3567f78.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=yp51XP3PshsNyEILIzFj3c2yOMY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

It's as if your words are the only words that will ever matter, whether you're talking about something silly or something serious. \nThe 15-year-old knows the value of hearing what people say. That's because she's used to not being heard.\nSEE ALSO: This blind Apple engineer is transforming the tech world at only 22\nMeera is nonverbal, living with a rare condition called schizencephaly that impacts her ability to speak. But with the help of her iPad and text-to-speech technology, she can make her thoughts and opinions known — and she sure does. From her love of Katy Perry to her passion for soccer, Meera will let you know exactly what's on her mind. All it takes is a few taps of her tablet, and with a specialized app stringing letters into words, and words into phrases, her thoughts are played out loud.\nMeera's relationship with tech is just one of seven stories featured in a powerful video series created by Apple to spotlight the company's dedication to accessible technology. The videos were released in celebration of Global Accessibility Awareness Day on May 18, a day emphasizing the importance of accessible tech and design.\n\n\"We see accessibility as a basic human right,\" says Sarah Herrlinger, senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives at Apple. \"We want more and more people out there to not only see the work we're doing, but realize the importance of accessibility in general.\"\nThe videos showcase users with a wide range of disability identities and experiences — from Carlos Vasquez, a blind metal drummer, to Shane Rakowski, a music teacher with hearing loss. \n\"Now people know I have a lot to say. They know I am smart. They know me. They see me now as Meera.\"\nAnd then there's spunky Meera, who likes to gossip and giggle with her friends on the side of the soccer field and mostly uses her iPad and a text-to-speech app to do so. Her natural voice can only force out short words like \"no\" and \"yes.\" While Meera knows sign language, the majority of her friends don't.\nThough she now has tech that works for her, it took Meera a long time to find a way to express herself. In fact, until 10 years ago, getting access to any assistive technology wasn't even possible.\nMeera was born in India, living on the streets of New Delhi until she was adopted by her moms at age 5. She was nonverbal and homeless from birth, meaning she had no education and few ways of communicating. \nBut through accessible technology, along with education and sign-language learning, Meera has gained multiple ways to communicate.\n\"Now people know I have a lot to say,\" says Meera, who now lives in Atlanta with her moms and younger brother, Tucker. \"They know I am smart. They know me. They see me now as Meera — their friend, their student, their neighbor. They know I have opinions and good ideas.\"\n\nAccessibility features come standard with each Apple product, meeting a user's needs right out of the box. That's unparalleled in the mainstream tech industry, making the company a favorite of people with disabilities.\n\"There's not just one feature that encompasses 'accessibility,'\" Herrlinger says. \"There’s really a depth and breadth to what 'accessibility' means.\"\nWhen I ask Meera via video chat how it feels to be able to communicate through her iPad, she taps out an answer on her tablet's keyboard, letter by letter. When she's finished, she plays it through a robotic voice: \"It makes me feel happy and smart.\"\n\"There’s really a depth and breadth to what 'accessibility' means.\"\n\"You are smart,\" says Meera's mother, Carolyn Phillips, after hearing her answer. And she is. \nOnce, for example, Carolyn entered the house to hear the family's Amazon Echo inexplicably blaring Taylor Swift's newest album. Carolyn knew Meera, the only person home at the time, couldn't speak to the Echo to activate Alexa. Convinced the speaker was on the fritz, Carolyn turned off Taylor's tunes.\nBut a couple of minutes later, Swift's songs were booming yet again. Carolyn then realized Meera had hacked the system, connecting the Echo to her iPad to have it follow her commands. By making the two pieces of tech \"talk\" to each other, she could play Taylor Swift at top volume whenever she wanted.\nThe features built into each Apple device, Herrlinger says, allow people with disabilities to customize their devices to suit their own needs — even if one of those needs is blasting \"Blank Space.\"\nMiddle school music teacher Shane Rakowski, for example, uses her iPhone to control her hearing aids, with the ability to toggle between a standard mode and a music mode. The music mode helps amplify low notes Rakowski can't hear otherwise, while the standard mode helps her to instruct her students.  \n\nRakowski discovered her hearing loss four years ago while teaching a music class in Williamsburg, Virginia. One of her students was hitting the low notes on a marimba — but Rakowski didn't hear any sound.\nSuddenly, things started to click. It had always been hard for her to understand the low voices of men, and she always spoke with a loud voice, even in one-on-one conversations. Now these low notes — notes her students could hear clearly — registered only as silence.\n\"The kids call them my bionic ears. They say I can hear everything now.\"\nRakowski, whose musical passion and profession rely on the ability to hear, started using hearing aids a little over a year ago. She switched to an iPhone from another phone company because of Apple's accessible technology. \n\"There's definitely a difference in the way I'm teaching after getting hearing aids,\" she says. \"The students say I'm not as loud as I used to be. I can hear a student's question without asking the whole class to quiet down. I can hear kids talking in the back of the classroom, doing things they aren't quiet supposed to be doing. \n\"The kids call them my bionic ears. They say I can hear everything now.\"\n\nCarlos Vasquez, a blind metal drummer and professional gamer from Houston, Texas, needs something incredibly different from technology than Rakowski. Yet, he uses the same products she does; he just tailors them differently to fit his needs. \n\"A lot of times when people think of accessibility, they think things need to be 'dumbed down.' That's not true.\"\nWhile Rakowski relies on visuals to control the volume of sounds coming through her hearing aids, Vasquez relies completely on sound to navigate his Apple devices. His device speaks aloud what would normally be seen, with Vasquez using taps of his finger and his voice to select options and perform tasks.  \n\"You basically have this device that, out of the box, is accessible to someone who is blind,\" he says. \"You turn on this feature, and you can use it like anyone else. A lot of times when people think of accessibility, they think things need to be 'dumbed down.' That's not true. It's just a different way of doing the same thing.\"\nVasquez was born with cataracts, which were partially removed when he was very young. After the surgery, he had crystal clear, 20/20 vision. But the cataracts weren't removed completely, and before his teens, Vasquez developed glaucoma.\nAt 10, his vision started to fade. By 28, he was completely blind.\n\nNow, Vasquez says he's adapted to blindness with the help of tech, using his iPhone to assist him in everyday tasks, like making phone calls or using social media.\n\"With over a billion people on the planet with a disability, that’s a billion reasons for accessible design.\"\n\"Technology doesn't change your life,\" he says. \"What changes your life are the things you do for yourself — and then technology can come in and enhance what you are already doing.\"\nFor Vasquez, that means using tech to assist him in handling social media and public relations for his metal band, Distartica. By using VoiceOver, one of Apple's most well-known accessibility features, Vasquez has access to the same functions as a sighted person.\nApple says this universal, customizable accessibility is the driving force behind its innovations for people with disabilities.\n\"With over a billion people on the planet with a disability,\" Herrlinger says, \"that's a billion reasons for accessible design.\"\n\nWhen I ask Meera if she has anything else to add before we stop video chatting, she keeps coming up with something else to say. She's a true chatterbox — a captivating teen with stories to tell. But sometimes, even with accessible tech, it still isn't easy to be heard. \nTyping your thoughts letter by letter, even with the aid of text prediction, is tedious work. It allows Meera to be deliberate with her thoughts, but also causes people who are used to quick conversations to lose interest. Meera often struggles to hook people in, failing to keep them around long enough for a discussion.\n\"Before I had the iPhone and iPad, people treated me like I had a disability. They talked about me, not to me.\" \nTo prevent this, Meera has pre-written statements plugged into her speech-to-text app to help her introduce herself. She plays some for me with the simple tap of a button. One describes her harrowing time as a toddler on the streets of New Delhi. Another explains all the things she likes to do, like playing soccer and listening to music, in hopes of finding friends with common interests. \nThe tactic isn't flawless, however. People of all ages still walk away from Meera out of impatience or frustration. But even though Meera has to type out every letter, word, and phrase, she says being able to assert her voice is worth it. \n\"Before I had the iPhone and iPad, people treated me like I had a disability,\" Meera says. \"They talked about me, not to me.

It also claims that the average time spent on the app is a handsome 40 minutes. \n\nWhat makes Byju's — a two-year-old company — unique?\nIn the words of its founder, Byju Raveedran, “Learning through technology triggers changes in how students consume content. It offers them newer ways to explore concepts and initiate learning on their own.\"\nPerhaps that is what drew the attention of Mark Zuckerberg as well.\nLast September as the CZI led a $50 million investment in Byju's, the Facebook founder wrote, \"I'm optimistic about personalized learning and the difference it can make for students everywhere.\"\n\"That's why it's a major focus of our education efforts, and why we're looking forward to working with companies like BYJU's to get these tools into the hands of more students and teachers around the world,\" he added.\nNot only Zuckerberg, Byju's drew an undisclosed investment from World Bank's International Finance Corporation too. With these dollars, the startup plans to roll out new products and expand into the US and the UK. \nMeanwhile, the Harvard case study, which has been authored by John Jong-Hyun Kim, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, and Rachna Tahilyani, associate director, Harvard Business School India Research Center, is available for teaching purposes within and outside Harvard.\n\"It is very humbling to have our brand story as a Harvard Business School case study. This further encourages us to innovate and build learning programs to revolutionize education and create a whole new segment of self-paced learners globally,” said founder Raveendran in a statement. \nWATCH: Harvard scientists have created the rarest material on

LGBTQ pride and identity around the globe, thanks to artist and activist Gilbert Baker. He created the rainbow flag in 1978, as a way to represent the vibrancy of the queer community.\nBaker died on March 31, but his legacy and vision of the LGBTQ community lives on through a new, creative medium — a rainbow typeface created in his name.\nSEE ALSO: LGBTQ community responds perfectly after being accused of stealing God's rainbow\nThe eye-catching typeface, simply called \"Gilbert,\" features gently rounded letters with strokes in eight different colors paying tribute to Baker's rainbow flag.\n\nThough the flag has since been updated to feature only six colors, Baker designed his original flag with colors representing eight pillars of the LGBTQ community: pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for the sun, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for harmony, and purple for spirit.\nThe rainbow version of the typeface unapologetically invokes LGBTQ pride, but \"Gilbert\" is also available for download in black, creating a sleeker and more understated look.\n\nThe technicolor font was created through a partnership called Type With Pride, spearheaded by media and arts organization NewFest, NYC Pride, Ogilvy & Mather's design agency, and font creation platform Fontself.\nThe organizations decided to memorialize Baker in a typeface because he was known for using his artistic talents to help friends create banners for protests and marches. They wanted Baker's creative contributions in LGBTQ activism to persist, even after his death.\n\"We wanted to create something special that would not just honor Gilbert and his iconic rainbow flag, but also give the LGBTQ community a fantastic tool to help them create their own banners, posters, and signs,\" Ogilvy & Mather's design team said in a press release. \"People can now raise the rainbow flag with every letter they type.\"\n\nThe typeface is available for free download here. The creators also encourage members of the community to share their creations with the font, using the hashtag #TypeWithPride.\nWATCH: What it's really like to be LGBTQ and Muslim"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F454411%252Ff4e2fa99-c85c-4145-a658-e2cad0b9e788.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=AIdP8oiqHKNP5V2b9-gNTbDCzSc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43530%252F511c8f51-a028-48ab-beb5-80e181bee25a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=M2P8BBq5lGkYSYclBQ85XzHQBUs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43530%252F511c8f51-a028-48ab-beb5-80e181bee25a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=dmGomWyS4ti58aAgFuGah4batkA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43530%252F511c8f51-a028-48ab-beb5-80e181bee25a.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=dqwWdL2NliMwFIU4BbY2IJhdIiE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43530%252F511c8f51-a028-48ab-beb5-80e181bee25a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=_3WXIN6pO0vtISfL_C2O2JN2NHE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43530%252F511c8f51-a028-48ab-beb5-80e181bee25a.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=s5zFLt3Lg8X4kXTQEPEgi754rTs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F454411%252Ff4e2fa99-c85c-4145-a658-e2cad0b9e788.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F454411%252Ff4e2fa99-c85c-4145-a658-e2cad0b9e788.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F454411%252Ff4e2fa99-c85c-4145-a658-e2cad0b9e788.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=s99ysuov6xOeaGBaGGPTseZ2Rz8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F454411%252Ff4e2fa99-c85c-4145-a658-e2cad0b9e788.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=BZyrihOXDZroDeLuf-vAWWJv72c=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Type With Pride"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"This technicolor typeface honors the creator of the LGBTQ pride flag","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"bZu08Zgm","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"People can now raise the rainbow flag with every letter they type.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Social%20Good/","tweet_text":"This technicolor typeface honors the creator of the LGBTQ pride flag"},{"_id":"58f7a8b1f11b2c326b000747","id":"/2017/04/19/coding-autism-tech-industry-skills/","title":"This coding startup trains autistic people to take on the tech industry","title_tag":null,"author":"Katie Dupere","post_date":"2017-04-19T18:13:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:13:03 +0000","formatted_date":"04/19/2017","sort_key":"1D0Xxl","link":"https://mashable.com/2017/04/19/coding-autism-tech-industry-skills/","content":{"plain":"People on the autism spectrum are getting the support and skills they need to break into the tech industry. And it's all thanks to a new program for autistic people, by autistic people.\nA new startup called Coding Autism, which launched earlier this month, is developing a school in Los Angeles to teach autistic people coding, web development, and software engineering skills. \nSEE ALSO: 8 ingenious innovations helping autistic children communicate\nParticipants in the program will attend a 15-week, full-time bootcamp to build up their tech talents. The program also includes resume workshops, career counseling, interview preparation, and access to professional mentors.\n\"We are creating a formula for success for autistic individuals.\"\nOnce they graduate the program, Coding Autism will help participants find employment in the tech industry. Students will also showcase their portfolios on Coding Autism's website, so potential employers can find them.\nOliver Thornton, CEO and cofounder of Coding Autism, created the program to help autistic people like himself get into stable, lucrative tech careers.\n\"We are creating a formula for success for autistic individuals for them to thrive in their professions and their lives,\" Thornton said in a video promoting the project.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 adults in the U.S. fall somewhere on the autism spectrum. Even though the prevalence of autism is quite high, stigma and misconceptions around autism spectrum disorders still impact the community — especially when it comes to employment. According to the United Nations, the unemployment rate of autistic adults is estimated to be 80 percent.\nAbout 500,000 programming and engineering jobs open up each year in the tech industry, meaning there's massive potential for new talent to enter the profession. Yet only 1 percent of those positions are filled with autistic talent.\n\"I think a lot of autistic people like to do coding because it keeps your mind going.\" \nMany autistic adults, however, have excelled in the tech industry because of intrinsic attention to detail and fascination with repetitive tasks, according to Coding Autism.\n\"I think a lot of autistic people like to do coding because it keeps your mind going,\" one program participant said in the video. \"It gives you something to do that's new and fun and exciting.\"\nCoding Autism is crowdfunding to completely cover the tuition for the inaugural class of 15 students. At the time of writing, the company has raised almost $40,000 of its $50,000 goal. \nBut the program, Thornton said, isn't just about closing the employment gap for autistic adults. It's also about bettering tech companies and their products by including the autistic community's essential perspective.\n\"By training adults with autism through our autism specialized coding immersive program, we are opening doors for companies to diversify their workforces, broaden the culture of their company and teams, and drive innovation within their operations,” Thornton said.\nThe first Coding Autism class is slated to begin in late summer or early fall of this year. As the program grows, the startup plans to offer online classes to reach even more autistic people across the U.S.\n[H/T The Mighty]\nWATCH: New smart ball is a learning tool specially designed for autistic children"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451887%252Feee12487-a569-4e09-a912-72223d0f416f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=j8413_Yiw3jXklrgMfVKh3ARBYA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43301%252F19e812a6-20df-4650-a064-2e9e634a3173.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=TjSBND9vbzY9Ww9Om05pzOpwtKk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43301%252F19e812a6-20df-4650-a064-2e9e634a3173.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=EH0jGhSPqKWl5MSiJU9ml5WRrpY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43301%252F19e812a6-20df-4650-a064-2e9e634a3173.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=apCeeYuhTlV3rsUcsDAMhtqkltk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43301%252F19e812a6-20df-4650-a064-2e9e634a3173.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ZCEyfCWrJwKiIsCeZkY6QM9m0Ps=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43301%252F19e812a6-20df-4650-a064-2e9e634a3173.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=2vsaOrlsq_CKnkqhSsc43m7CYuQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"A new school called Coding Autism is coming to Los Angeles to help get autistic people into tech fields.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451887%252Feee12487-a569-4e09-a912-72223d0f416f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451887%252Feee12487-a569-4e09-a912-72223d0f416f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451887%252Feee12487-a569-4e09-a912-72223d0f416f.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=z4vy_38qrKz532HO7adCzpHmaCs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451887%252Feee12487-a569-4e09-a912-72223d0f416f.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=y0KyXaKBj4tQPrpvqg86dafGvK8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"A new school called Coding Autism is coming to Los Angeles to help get autistic people into tech fields."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Coding Autism"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"This coding startup trains autistic people to take on the tech industry","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"m0CX2Ptk","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"Autistic people like to do coding because it keeps your mind going.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"This coding startup trains autistic people to take on the tech industry"},{"_id":"58f6e31f28cc36229d00018b","id":"/2017/04/19/2017-library-building-awards/","title":"Marvel (quietly) at the top eight most beautifully designed libraries","title_tag":null,"author":"Johnny Lieu","post_date":"2017-04-19T04:10:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 04:10:02 +0000","formatted_date":"04/19/2017","sort_key":"1D0NPr","link":"https://mashable.com/2017/04/19/2017-library-building-awards/","content":{"plain":"A good book and a beautiful library certainly sounds like a match made in heaven to us.\nYou can dream on, with these eight libraries recognised in the 2017 AIA/ALA Library Building Awards. Just dream quietly please.\nSEE ALSO: 20 stunning editions of classic books you'll want to add to your library\nAwarded by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the American Library Association (ALA), the program encourages and recognises excellence in the architectural design of libraries. \nProjects can be located anywhere around the world, but only those designed by an architect licensed in the U.S. can be submitted in the competition. \nStill, these libraries are worth marvelling (quietly) at. Ah, we can almost hear the beautiful silence.\nBoston Public Library, Central Library Renovation\n\nThe central branch of the Boston Public Library received renovations throughout the last two years, transforming one wing of the library from a stone bunker originally constructed in 1895 to a light-filled space that opens up to a newly-built public plaza.\nColumbus Metropolitan Library – Whitehall\n\nFilled with natural light, the library on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio is as much a community venue as it is a place of knowledge. The inside is a large rectangular space which accommodates bookshelves, an area for teenagers and children, public computers and a quiet room.\nEast Boston Branch Library\n\nA \"one room\" concept, East Boston's new library features separate areas for adults, teens and children without splitting these groups into separate rooms. The undulating roof lets in just the right amount of sunlight over the airy column-free reading room.\nNational Library of Latvia\n\nA new library spanning more than 600,000 square feet (182,000 square metres), Latvia's National Library was designed to store, preserve and make accessible the country's cultural heritage. Here state-of-the-art technology makes digitisation and storage easier, with building making its mark on Riga's skyline.\nNew York Public Library, Stapleton Branch Renovation and Expansion\n\nAn expansion of a single-room library, this branch library in Stapleton, Staten Island has been given an upgrade to better suit the needs of the local community. The library's exposed wood structure is certainly warm and alluring, melding together new and old buildings.\nRosa F. Keller Library and Community Center, New Orleans\n\nLocated in New Orleans' Broadmoor neighbourhood, the library is a symbol of the community's recovery following Hurricane Katrina. It stands in an area earmarked for green space by a former city mayor, if not for the efforts of residents to ensure their local library was rebuilt.\nUniversity of Oregon Allan Price Science Commons & Research Library Remodel/Expansion\n\nDesigned with the input of students from the University of Oregon, the underground library was remodelled to maximise the amount of natural light that could flow below. The library's print collection was downsized to increase communal space, as student interaction became a priority.\nVarina Area Library, Virginia\n\nFormerly a private residence, the Varina Area Library serves a primarily rural community. Much of its surrounding landscaping has been left untouched, with a floor plan designed to maximise the view of the land around the building.\nLibraries: Long may they receive funding and thrive.\nWATCH: Someone combined the best parts of the Kindle and iPad"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451120%252Fe838dc14-45f0-4754-a57c-babe624cc77b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=R4UVlcAZKuAkaIgHpk_nxBKvXP8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43217%252Ff038a106-3377-4c53-99ed-8bf064741b07.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=o7ifoRXwZ6gWROXZ5z8hmU2QDiI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43217%252Ff038a106-3377-4c53-99ed-8bf064741b07.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=XptDrvmXrXF9qCh_0_uDmbv0jmQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43217%252Ff038a106-3377-4c53-99ed-8bf064741b07.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=LBe73eNByI3isObxbafUjXX-ZLc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43217%252Ff038a106-3377-4c53-99ed-8bf064741b07.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=8Yj_8XDOCxObllOwzKik1SMv9xQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F43217%252Ff038a106-3377-4c53-99ed-8bf064741b07.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=dtNIoZLbjUbJV7odJz_6f_XpROo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The stunning East Boston Branch Library.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451120%252Fe838dc14-45f0-4754-a57c-babe624cc77b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451120%252Fe838dc14-45f0-4754-a57c-babe624cc77b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451120%252Fe838dc14-45f0-4754-a57c-babe624cc77b.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-t69q9TTuzaNS85n2MiLzSmN5wQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F451120%252Fe838dc14-45f0-4754-a57c-babe624cc77b.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=d6WPF049RkZGblu1b-RnBARk5a8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The stunning East Boston Branch Library."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  robert benson photography"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Marvel (quietly) at the top eight most beautifully designed libraries","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"dEKvbuwd","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Worth looking up from your book.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Marvel (quietly) at the top eight most beautifully designed libraries"},{"_id":"58f608ec9111ae2c15000352","id":"/2017/04/18/understanding-homelessness-map-data-viz/","title":"These engaging, hyper-visual maps can help us better understand homelessness","title_tag":null,"author":"Matt Petronzio","post_date":"2017-04-18T12:39:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 12:39:07 +0000","formatted_date":"04/18/2017","sort_key":"1D0x7L","link":"https://mashable.com/2017/04/18/understanding-homelessness-map-data-viz/","content":{"plain":"A new data project immediately hits you with a simple yet devastating message on its homepage: \"The issue of modern homelessness is broad and complex, affecting too many of our neighbors and communities.\"\nBut not all hope is lost. And for the site Understanding Homelessness, that's the goal — to explore solutions to this intractable problem across the U.S. through compelling data visualizations, maps, and human-centered design.\nSEE ALSO: 8 innovations helping homeless populations around the world\nThe project, which is supported by the Massachusetts-based design firm Sasaki, aims to fight stigma surrounding people experiencing homelessness through education and transparency. By compiling various aspects of data into interactive maps, Understanding Homelessness offers an engaging and digestible look at the problem.\nAnd it could inspire city officials, nonprofits, and even you to come up with impactful solutions.\n\nGretchen Keillor, an urban and campus planner with Sasaki and project lead for Understanding Homelessness, said the impetus for the project was a mix of personal and professional. She used to live in a part of Cambridge where she saw people experiencing homelessness every day — on her commute to work, while running errands, coming home from a dinner out.\n\"I wanted to engage with the issue beyond giving someone spare change, and remind myself — and others — that this is a human problem, deserving of compassion,\" Keillor said.\nProfessionally, she wanted to better grasp the complexity of the issue as a planner, understanding the needs and concerns of homeless populations. So she applied for and received a grant through Sasaki's research program, which allows designers to dive deeper into areas that, according to Keillor, \"perhaps do not have immediate, direct application to our practice today, but can inform our work, perspectives, and capabilities going forward.\"\n\nFor the map, Keillor and her team used data from January 2015, when volunteers around the country counted 546,580 homeless people in the U.S. One dot on the map represents five people experiencing homelessness. (More recent estimates from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development show that homelessness affects roughly 560,000.)\n\"It's the 'where do you even start?' syndrome. I wanted to help overcome this heaviness.\"\nUsing Continuity, Sasaki's custom-built data viz tool, users can see information about homeless populations through the lens of a range of geographic, economic, and social factors, and in a variety of formats like a map, grid, histogram, etc. You can also select \"Tell Me a Story,\" which illustrates takeaways you might find surprising. For example, homelessness is actually highest in areas where the unemployment rate is less than 5 percent.\nBut Keillor and her team, which includes two graphic designers and two developers, didn't necessarily set out to reveal anything groundbreaking or revolutionary. They just wanted to create an interface where they could view all of these factors juxtaposed with rates of homelessness to present a larger picture of the issue.\n\nWhile the map is the cornerstone of the project, it's by no means the only feature of the project. True to its name, Understanding Homelessness offers a sort of primer on the issue — what Keillor likens to \"Homelessness 101.\" The site defines homelessness in simple terms, dispels misconceptions and stereotypes, and details out systemic causes like lack of affordable housing, a suffering economy, and a lack of supportive and health services. There's also a timeline of the evolution of homelessness in the U.S. since 1800 and a list of the three primary solutions (the housing-first approach, training and education, and essential support services). \n\"Data visualization brings a complex issue out of the vague, enormous, and overwhelming into the realm of personal, tangible, and grounded.\"\nLast but not least, Understanding Homelessness offers practical ways that people of all stripes can help. \n\"Another major challenge in discussing this issue is the... heavy, overwhelming nature of this complex human problem,\" Keillor said. \"It's the 'where do you even start?' syndrome. I wanted to help overcome this heaviness by providing bite-sized examples of tangible things that individuals or cities could do to start chipping away at the enormity of the problem.\"\nThe \"Strategies\" tab provides more than 80 examples from cities, organizations, and individuals around the world, with tips for public officials, designers, nonprofit workers, and, simply, concerned citizens.\n\"In general, the data visualization portion is pretty and shiny and rich with concrete numbers, but I think the upfront context to proactively address some of the stigmas is so important for someone to understand before they dive into the data,\" Keillor said. \"And once they've understood this context and explored the data, giving them tangible next steps and ways to help — answering that 'what can I do?' question — is equally important.\"\n\nFor Keillor, data mapping lends a tangible factor to complex social challenges — a concreteness to otherwise abstract and unwieldy issues. She said that at Sasaki, they've \"found again and again that seeing really is believing.\" And Understanding Homelessness takes that further, aiming to provide an experience of discovery, exploration, and perspective.\n\"Data visualization brings a complex issue out of the vague, enormous, and overwhelming into the realm of personal, tangible, and grounded,\" Keillor said. \"A transformation that is helpful for any social cause.\"\nWATCH: This coat doubles as a sleeping bag to keep the homeless warm in the

whole bunch of money to security-savvy Switch owners that can find vulnerabilities in the company's latest console. Finding and submitting a big security problem could see you walking away with a cool $20,000.\nNintendo expanded its public security flaw hunt to the Nintendo Switch yesterday, offering up compensation to anyone who finds and reports new vulnerabilities in the month-old console. Depending on the severity of the flaw, its exploitability, and the quality of the report, bug hunters could earn between $100 and $20,000.\nSEE ALSO: A 10-year-old hacked Instagram so Facebook gave him $10,000\nNintendo already offers rewards for vulnerability reports on the Nintendo 3DS and New 3DS through the bug-hunting website HackerOne. The project first launched for Nintendo in December 2016 and has already paid out rewards to three individuals (unfortunately we don't know how much they made for their efforts).\nNintendo is specifically looking for system vulnerabilities in these areas:\n\n  Privilege escalation from userland\n  Kernel takeover\n  ARM® TrustZone® takeover\n  Userland takeover (for applications)\n\nIf you find a new vulnerability worthy of reporting, Nintendo will reward you after it has fixed the problem or within four months of receiving the report.\nOther companies in the tech world offer similar programs that have seen successful bug hunters earning huge chunks of money, including Google and Facebook. This kind of crowdsourced flaw-hunting allows tech companies to get extra eyes on their hardware and software, bringing in people who may notice bugs that companies’ own security teams miss.\nWATCH:

The world's fastest tank. \nAnd it is real.\nThe new favorite vehicle of Tej Parker (played by Ludacris) you'll see shredding ice this weekend in The Fate of the Furious isn't just some vehicle production designer's dream. It's a bona fide military asset, albeit one that's still in testing phase.\nBut it's safe to say its screen-test went pretty well. \nSEE ALSO: New 'Dunkirk' footage is a heart-pounding Christopher Nolan master class\nIn this behind-the-scenes video clip (above) that Mashable can exclusively debut, we see the Ripsaw in action. Hard, ruthless, punishing action, brought to you by Fate director F. Gary Gray & Co., who clearly weren't afraid to put it through its paces.\nThe Ripsaw was developed by Maine-based Howe & Howe Technologies, which specializes in lightweight military-grade vehicles. It's powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter V8 diesel engine and mounts an M153 CROWS weapons station, capable of handling up to a .50-caliber machine gun.\nAt 750 horsepower and under 10,000 pounds, the Ripsaw is capable of just over 100 mph, but is too light and too fast to really be classified as a standard tank. And it doesn't really have the same heavy armor or firepower of the Army's go-to battle tanks, which can be twice as heavy.\nWhat it does have is speed, versatility and armaments that are in many ways superior to the classic Humvee. And like the tried-and-true Hummer, it's a genuine military vehicle that also has a super high-end luxury version available on the commercial market.\nThe Ripsaw also has a driverless, remote-controlled version -- but the one in The Fate of the Furious is clearly in Tej's control. Just how he likes it.\nThe Ripsaw is ready for its closeup this weekend, when The Fate of the Furious hits theaters.\nWATCH: Here are 7 'Fast & Furious' facts every ultimate fan should know\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=yaxbUJ6x6266xig123EkZC2toj0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=F-QhcJmckxKLj0_0IDkIco18lpc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F356x205.png?signature=kEK3dxSUdQ2LIWZZucxYmwfawcs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F712x410.png?signature=jBqhmaZgXEMy63093zcK_m4n25c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F280x157.png?signature=j13FgulOm8-G5RRBRpYJ3ouaHjM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F42220%252F1ccaa03b-d0f3-4cab-bb91-9914bdae5109.png%252F560x314.png?signature=2HtxuxXkEJMFAYJAYcsiIkEAPic=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"That sick 'Fate of the Furious' tank is a real Army vehicle?

But how would I go about translating such an ephemeral idea into visual form? Honestly, I had no idea.\nSEE ALSO: Meet the podcast proving that the future of sex tech is female\nStock imagery has played a significant role in developing the visual language of technology. If you imagine all hackers wear black and hunch over green screens in dark rooms, that's thanks to film and television to be sure, but also because of the creative images that accompany stories on websites like this one.\nYes, a lot of technology stock imagery is seriously bizarre -- see the infamous bitcoin gold coin -- but as people in the business told me, translating the digital into useful, 2D form is no easy feat.\nLooking for symbols\nHow do you make bitcoin, a concept that exists entirely online, easily identifiable to anyone?\nStruggling to find a representation of the cryptocurrency, Colorado-based artist Arina Habich tracked down bitcoin \"miners\" -- small machines that run software to unlock more bitcoin -- and used them to create a collection on Shutterstock.\n\"I had to talk to lots of people to do this, and had to do lots of research to find a really good place to really capture \"bitcoins\" as an idea,\" she said via email. \"I've found that these are useful representatives of cryptocurrency as a whole.\"\n\nIt's a similar challenge for something like \"data.\" When developing a stock concept, Bruce Rolff, who lives just outside New York City, said he often thinks in symbols. \n\"Binary code is a good general element for data. For security, it might be a keyhole or a padlock,\" he explained. \"To represent the internet I might use the Earth, a computer mouse, a spider like web of binary code. For the cloud I might use an illustrated cloud with points of light.\"\nHe also takes colour into account. Popular colours for data are often cool greens or blues. Do you associate bright yellow with coding? Probably not, and those implicit connections (or lack thereof) are thanks in no small part to choices made by people like Rolff.\nThe abstract and reality\nCreating a stock image for a technology concept can be an intensely creative process. That's reflected in Rolff's portfolio, which is distinctly hallucinatory with clear science fiction influences.\nSome images he likes better than others. For example, he's fan of a picture he created of a female android. \"Shiny bronze or copper metallic skin covered with electronic circuit patterns. Vivid red hair, a slight knowing smile, her eyes looking with intent into the viewer,\" he explained over email. \"Just think it's a cool character.\"\n\nUsing products like Photoshop, Adobe Bridge, Poser and Blender, he said he likes pushing the boundaries of technique and content. \"I like the idea of mixing text into the work. Also the meshing of abstract and reality,\" he added.\nRolff said people he understands why people make fun of \"crazy, goofy\" stock images, but emphasised they perform a valuable service. \n\"Many people can find the right image for their projects, be it a book cover, album cover, web site, whatever, thanks to stock images produced by many hard working people,\" he added. \n\"It's somewhat hard to really get things 100% 'right,'\" Habich added. \"However hard I work, I find that there is no better image than the one you'll be shooting tomorrow.\"\nStock photographers are artists, but also journalists\nAccording to Habich and Rolff, the industry is all about anticipating need.\nHabich has been in the business for six years. Photographers are rarely commissioned, she explained. Instead, they create images they suspect will be topical and required for books, websites and magazines, and that means keeping an eye on the news like any reporter. She said demand for bitcoin stock, for example, developed about three years ago.\nFor the most part, photographers get paid only if their pictures are licensed from photo agencies like Shutterstock or iStock. \n\n\"There is no real 'requests' when it comes to stock photography -- there is supply and demand,\" she said. \"You can see what types of things are popular -- what's in magazines and TV, what people are talking about, and really topical things.\"\nIt's not necessarily a way to get rich quick, either. \nShutterstock contributors, for example, are paid depending on the license -- the percentage is also raised as earnings increase. For each image downloaded as a monthly subscriber image, for example, a contributor might be paid $0.25 in the first tier.\nRolff lives off his stock photographer work, but as a producer of images, he said it would be nice to be better rewarded. \"But it is what it is,\" he added. \"The market is quite competitive.\"\nSo, what did I learn? Pay your stock photographers some respect. It's not that easy to make an image of the internet.\nWATCH: Old-school arcade games have made a comeback at this underground gaming tournament"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F438777%252Ff68b97fe-5d0b-4d10-9d25-14aad6d36b8c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=NV5T6QyFFo2iy7hApESVrNNU8NU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41895%252F5b0a98a3-992e-4e1f-816b-8054f605f233.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RRJ6xkb9RQjzgUk3-FZQZF8H-dU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41895%252F5b0a98a3-992e-4e1f-816b-8054f605f233.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ol0P_c9etLv2luCOvgBepsR53zM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41895%252F5b0a98a3-992e-4e1f-816b-8054f605f233.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=tDICQnNgZQTpx1ypT8Iq0GgzEb0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41895%252F5b0a98a3-992e-4e1f-816b-8054f605f233.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=gEwGKhT0iG3eopRMDiTsbuWqev8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41895%252F5b0a98a3-992e-4e1f-816b-8054f605f233.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=H_MvEvOBmLsAwYOyilALzzLR4Fk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"\"Golden Bitcoins on a gold background.\"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F438777%252Ff68b97fe-5d0b-4d10-9d25-14aad6d36b8c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F438777%252Ff68b97fe-5d0b-4d10-9d25-14aad6d36b8c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F438777%252Ff68b97fe-5d0b-4d10-9d25-14aad6d36b8c.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=K8WXJvHiRbI07t-NIPiukwPQeaA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F438777%252Ff68b97fe-5d0b-4d10-9d25-14aad6d36b8c.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jJXv4v6-yYDSl9zjnlw73bWHQmY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"\"Golden Bitcoins on a gold background.\""}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Shutterstock / Julia Tsokur"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"There's more to tech stock photography than hokey gold bitcoins","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"PNEA77BK","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The other stock market.

The Touch Bar famously debuted with the 2016 MacBook Pro, replacing the row of function keys with a much more functional super-responsive OLED touch panel. \nSince the computer's release last November, the Touch Bar has been used in countless different ways, from the functional to the frivolous, and it's proven to be a killer addition to the keyboard we never knew we needed -- even if it's not as sexy as some of Apple's fanboys would've liked. Bringing it to more keyboards is just the next logical step.\nSEE ALSO: Don't cry for Mac Mini, it's still part of Apple's lineup\nThe patents, which were unearthed by AppleInsider, all describe the means for creating a \"Keyboard with Adaptive Input Row,\" aka the Touch Bar. The filings appear to be essentially identical. \nThe text of the patents mostly provide directions for how the touch-controlled tech actually works, rather than its application in different systems -- but images included in the filings appear to show it outside of the MacBook Pro's laptop housing. \n\nApple's wireless Magic Keyboard accessory could be the best candidate for Touch Bar treatment. It could become the premier accessory for Apple's computers -- or, the company could decide to release the Touch Bar tech across all of its keyboard lines. \nGiven Apple's track record of slow rollouts for new features and tiered product classes, that wholesale adoption is probably unlikely. This is just a patent, anyway, so there's no way of know if Apple actually has any plans to give any other keyboards the Touch Bar feature. \nThe latest word out of Cupertino promises a 2018 overhaul to the Mac Pro and a more imminent update to the iMac, which proves that Apple is ready for some shakeups in the computing department -- but don't get too ahead of yourself. Phil Schiller, Apple senior VP of worldwide marketing, promises there will not be touchscreens. Instead, you could just get your touch fix from your keyboard.\nWATCH: A new way to take selfies — and six other features the iPhone 8 might have"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F437148%252F8f6f29cd-1160-4788-9014-e473a75e4a5d.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=H7cgg_3LPtok93qvzgkUfUkGtYM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41869%252F2e2aed33-01a6-4f78-9bff-9a60147641f0.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=wUd_SXNuVrcsXzd41E9GFgkwKpY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41869%252F2e2aed33-01a6-4f78-9bff-9a60147641f0.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=_wB_XwvttHeO_h7GgETRAB_JJeE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41869%252F2e2aed33-01a6-4f78-9bff-9a60147641f0.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=4o2RBy6c2DMaPVThufx04ghLIJY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41869%252F2e2aed33-01a6-4f78-9bff-9a60147641f0.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=URUICtbfym9ygqHdzKQYe-WIIQ4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41869%252F2e2aed33-01a6-4f78-9bff-9a60147641f0.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=0OWXgbdZVv1AapkSgKMeNJ0pCWo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The Touch Bar could find a home outside of just the MacBook Pro.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F437148%252F8f6f29cd-1160-4788-9014-e473a75e4a5d.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F437148%252F8f6f29cd-1160-4788-9014-e473a75e4a5d.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F437148%252F8f6f29cd-1160-4788-9014-e473a75e4a5d.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=cxV7BrG6W73J1ONZVkEhrbEzOHg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F437148%252F8f6f29cd-1160-4788-9014-e473a75e4a5d.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=qmHqP8EHR-Hoc1hRDXrgDXDJDRY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The Touch Bar could find a home outside of just the MacBook Pro."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  lili sams/mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Apple could bring the Touch Bar to even more keyboards because duh","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"whfsXByr","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Touch Bar could be everywhere!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Apple could bring the Touch Bar to even more keyboards because duh"},{"_id":"58e3e79328cc366f650002a1","id":"/2017/04/04/cosplay-ninja-cyborg-helmet/","title":"Engineer spent 7 months building an epic cyborg ninja helmet","title_tag":null,"author":"Nikolay Nikolov","post_date":"2017-04-04T18:36:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 18:36:00 +0000","formatted_date":"04/04/2017","sort_key":"1CVxZL","link":"https://mashable.com/2017/04/04/cosplay-ninja-cyborg-helmet/","content":{"plain":"Diego Valdes is a mechanical engineer and  an avid cosplayer.

Hundreds, maybe thousands of people across six different game development studios helped created it. Yet its camera -- a fundamental part of the way players interact with the game’s world -- is severely flawed. \nThe weight on the game’s metaphorical shoulders was enormous -- not just for the future of Final Fantasy as a game series, but possibly for the entire future of game consoles in Japan, according to game director Hajime Tabata. And it delivered on its enormous promise in many ways. How is it possible that a game into which so much was invested can have such a seemingly simplistic flaw?\nSEE ALSO: The painstaking process behind making strategy guides, from the guy who’s spent his life doing it\nThe camera is the interactive window through which we experience video games; the term describes not just our perspective and view of a digital space, but the freedom of or restrictions on how we as players control that viewpoint. \nThe camera is the interactive window through which we experience video games.\nYou can see and feel camera problems in games whenever the view is obstructed by a tree during a crucial moment, or when the perspective flips around the wrong way to show you the opposite of what you’re trying to look at, or when the camera just won’t do what you want no matter how you poke and prod at your controller.\nThese are the problems that have plagued third-person action games -- games in which the camera hovers outside the character’s body rather than peering through the character’s own perspective -- since Super Mario 64 popularized 3D games 20 years ago. How is it these issues haven’t been ironed out over the last two decades? What’s really going on in games that have camera problems? Why is it apparently so difficult to make video game cameras just work?\nWe reached out to the developers behind third-person games with their own unique camera challenges -- including Final Fantasy XV, Gravity Rush 2, Abzu, Hitman, and A Hat in Time -- to find out. \nThe common answer: it’s harder than you’d think to make a great video game camera.\nThe underwater problem\nMany developers run into problems making their cameras work in games that involve simply running around on the ground -- a 2D plane -- within a 3D space. Developer Giant Squid’s underwater exploration game Abzu adds another axis to that equation and a totally different set of control challenges -- problems that few developers of games with underwater controls have ever been able to solve.\n“It’s an interesting problem doing a camera in an underwater game because you have this unique environment where the character can swim in all three dimensions of the space,” said Matt Nava, Giant Squid’s founder and Abzu’s director.\n\nThe developers looked at every other underwater game they could get their hands on, and Nava said the most common solution in the past has been for developers to restrict player movement by not letting the character’s vertical pitch extend too far up or down -- preventing them from doing a vertical flip, basically.\n“One of the first things we did in Abzu was decide, you know what, we’re going to try and solve this problem. We’re going to let the player do full loops, because that’s super fun and graceful,” Nava said. “We had to solve: what happens when you’re upside-down?”\n“We had to solve: what happens when you’re upside-down?” - Matt Nava, Giant Squid\nWhat indeed? If the camera followed the character like it normally would, the camera would turn upside-down with the character, which would be nauseatingly disorienting. Instead, the game tracks multiple factors to detect when the player is attempting to do a loop or turn-around and automatically zooms the camera out to show the full arc. It tracks the character’s movement speed and the speed at which the character’s pitch is changing to determine how big the loop will be, and how far out the camera should move\n\nMeanwhile, if the player steers the character in a half loop, leaving the character facing the opposite direction and upside-down, the camera automatically sets itself back behind the character while the character flips over on its own. During this animation the game also briefly wrests camera control away from the player -- often a cardinal sin in action games, but a necessary one here.\n“We got it just right, so people didn’t really notice that there are moments in the game where steering doesn’t do anything,” Nava said.\nBalancing for two types of players\nTaking camera control away momentarily isn’t a perfect solution, though. More experienced players tend to move the camera manually more often than inexperienced ones who are less accustomed to steering characters through three-dimensional space. The veteran player wants full camera control, while the noob needs the camera to move automatically without them constantly adjusting it. Balancing between the two can be a massive headache.\nMany games’ solution is to let players adjust the camera but impose a timer that automatically resets it behind the character again if the game doesn’t detect any input from the player for a set amount of time.\n\nIssues can arise when that timer is too short or too long, especially in games where you move at high speeds, like driving games. If the camera takes too long to reset, inexperienced players might struggle with the controls. But if it resets too quickly, experienced players get annoyed feeling like they don’t have control over it. That’s one problem that plagued the late 2016 release The Last Guardian, a long-in-development game with lots of strengths but undeniably outdated controls and camera mechanics.\n“I think that probably the most common thing that [developers] do wrong with the camera is they try to auto-correct it at the wrong time -- they do it when you really want it to let you control it yourself,” Nava said.\n“It’s sometimes really, really hard to guess what the player actually wants to look at.” - Jesper Hylling, IO Interactive\nSquare Enix’s 2016 Hitman game does the exact opposite, to its great credit. “We are fairly atypical in the way that we actually allow the player to walk toward the camera,” said IO Interactive’s Jesper Hylling, Hitman’s lead game designer. “It’s much easier to control the character if you just look at his back all the time, and typically the direction you want to move is the direction you want to look. Except in Hitman, that’s not always the case.”\nOften in Hitman you need to observe a target while assassin Agent 47 faces the other direction to seem nonchalant, or flee from pursuers while keeping an eye on them. “So having a camera that tries to reset itself behind the shoulders of the main character wouldn’t really work for our game,” Hylling said. “Also you get to do these cool moments where you walk away from explosions.”\n\nThat also makes it the level designers’ responsibility to direct players’ attention towards timed, scripted events in subtle ways without having to yank the camera controls away from them. For example, in the game’s Paris mission the main target is first spotted descending a staircase in the mansion’s lavish entrance hall just as players walk in. He’s hard to miss, and that’s deliberate, Hylling said.\nThe drawback, he conceded, is that some players -- especially less experienced gamers -- struggle with the controls because they’re used to cameras that correct themselves. But “it’s sometimes really, really hard to guess what the player actually wants to look at,” he said. “So we try to do that as little as possible.”\nCamera controls as gameplay\nThe developers of Gravity Rush 2 faced a similar obstacle, compounded by the game’s unique premise. The early 2017 PS4 game’s gravity-shifting gameplay lets you totally alter the main character’s perspective at any time and hurtle through the air at great speeds in any direction. No rule of physics or game design is sacred -- even the horizon can flip this way and that, proving disorienting for many players.\n\nWith the game’s totally unfettered range of movement, it would have been impossible for the developers to design a system that could predict where players wanted to look to move the camera there automatically. So they didn’t try. Instead, they left the camera controls entirely to the player.\n“There were a lot of other challenges during game development, but designing the camera controls for this game is perhaps the challenge I remember most of all,” the game’s lead designer, Sony Computer Entertainment’s Junya Okura, said through a translator.\n“For this game, we made the decision to enable free-flowing travel and complete autonomy over camera control -- these two principles superseded all else,” the game’s lead player action programmer, Toshitake Tsuchikura, explained. “If we programed the camera to move automatically, the unique gameplay experience we crafted for players would suffer significantly.” Although newer players might find it hard to get used to, he said, they thought this totally free system would “satisfy our biggest fans” and that players would feel a sense of progression from mastering the camera controls over time.\nNo rule of physics or game design is sacred.\nEven so, Okura said their main objective in designing the camera was “to prevent a feeling among action game players who usually don’t have to think about controlling the camera from a feeling of being forced to do something that they’re not used to.” Tsuchikura added that they wanted the camera to “follow players’ intentions faithfully.”\nIn other words, they wanted control over the camera to feel natural, even for people who aren’t used to doing so in a game that leaves it entirely up to the player. To help accomplish that they made Kat, the game’s lovable protagonist, the camera’s focal point at all times -- she never leaves the center of the screen.\nMotion controls are another factor. By default, players can make fine camera adjustments by rotating the PS4’s DualShock controller, which Tsuchikura said “provides players with a feeling of true motion and a floating sensation.”\n“Free swirling with an unfixed horizontal line sometimes gives you strong motion sickness,” he said. “On the other hand, a sense of naturally swinging movements as if you’re floating in the air in this game is achieved through the motion sensor detecting the hands’ movement. It’s essential for the floating experience that Gravity Rush 2 is pursuing.”\n\nDesigning the camera’s behavior during Gravity Rush 2’s chaotic combat was its own challenge. Because enemies can appear all around Kat at any point, which the developers call “omnidirectional battles,” it remained important to let players retain full camera control during combat. But that also makes it difficult to track enemy locations, and more than one player has wondered why the game doesn’t provide a way to lock onto enemies.\nOkura said they considered adding a lock-on mechanic during the early phases of development on the original Gravity Rush, which launched on the portable PS Vita system in 2012. There were two sides to that internal debate, he said: on one hand, adding lock-on could make battles easier to manage, which would appeal to more players; but on the other hand, it would “destroy” the camera controls, the freedom of which is a core part of the series’ design. “The idea of trusting our players with autonomy matched with our design philosophy,” he explained.\n“This idea may be old fashioned, but I believe that it’s one of the important elements of action games to experience the joy of overcoming some difficulty or stress and to be proud of the improvement of your skill,” Tsuchikura added. “Please don’t be prejudiced against the right stick. It’s one of the powerful weapons for action gamers!”\nBreaking the line of sight\nEven a comparatively simpler game like the in-development A Hat in Time faces these problems. As a 3D platformer in the tradition of games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, AHiT wrestles with the same questions those pioneering games dealt with in the ‘90s.\n“Even though the game has an idea of the things the player thinks are interesting, it can be wrong,” said Jonas Kaerlev, CEO of small Danish studio Gears for Breakfast. “That’s why, if at any time in A Hat in Time the player moves the thumbstick, the game just says, ‘OK, we’ll chill out for a moment to let you do your thing, and then once we’ve figured out if you’re done with your thing, we’ll take over again.’”\n“Even though the game has an idea of the things the player thinks are interesting, it can be wrong.” - Jonas Kaerlev, Gears for Breakfast\nThe game reacts differently to varying amounts of input on the camera controls, including trying to detect accidental inputs in order to ignore them. But that’s an extremely resource-intensive process and can be taxing on the game’s overall systems, which Kaerlev said is why many modern platformers, like Super Mario 3D World, choose a fixed perspective rather than more traditional 3D camera controls.\n“Sometimes you just want to focus on the basics and always keep the camera on what’s interesting,” he said. Plus, that lets you avoid breaking what he said is one of the “golden rules” of game cameras: “never break line of sight.” In other words, the player always needs to be able to see the character they’re controlling, which can be difficult to accomplish when players have full movement and camera control.\n\nTraditional solutions for this vary. In Super Mario 64 the camera moves automatically to attempt to keep Mario in view, one of the many factors that made the 1997 classic’s pioneering 3D controls infamously wonky. The new The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild, on the other hand, handles obstacles like tree foliage by making them transparent if they would otherwise obscure your view of the hero, Link.\nBut Kaerlev said that can suck a game’s processing resources dry, especially as game graphics have become exponentially more complex over the years -- which is is why newer games (Breath of the Wild being an exception) tend to find other solutions.\n\"I quickly found out that players don’t want full control.\" - Kaerlev\nA Hat in Time uses a novel two-pronged approach. “Whenever we know the player is definitely, unquestionably going to have the camera be blocked by this thing, we put in the extra power [to turn the object transparent],” Kaerlev said. Other times, though, they simply draw the player character, Hat Kid, on top of the object as a silhouette, which accomplishes the same goal -- letting the player see the character at all times -- while using far less computing power.\n\nGears for Breakfast is a small studio, and Kaerlev is relatively inexperienced. But throughout development he’s been struck by the fact that developers of all sizes and backgrounds have wrestled with these issues throughout the history of video games -- but they’ve also all managed to come up with elegant solutions.\n“When I started development on A Hat in Time I had no idea how to make the camera,” Kaerlev said. “I just gave the player full control and said OK, whatever, do your thing. But I quickly found out that players don’t want full control. So I’ve sort of had to learn, as I’ve developed the game, that these kind of rules make a lot of sense. It’s kind of beautiful, in a way, that a lot of developers with very different backgrounds come to the same conclusions.”\nPutting the camera back in players’ hands\nThe problems with Final Fantasy XV’s camera weren’t due to inattention. Hidemi Mizoguchi, the very engineer responsible for the game’s camera system, made obvious the staggering consideration that went into its development at every step.\nYet FFXV’s camera is plagued by all the issues that many game developers strive to avoid -- from objects in the game obscuring your view of the camera to control being yanked away by the game.\nMizoguchi said (through a translator) that some of their challenges stemmed from the game’s wildly varying scenarios. You’re not just running around as main character Noctis. The game has to keep track of four characters plus multiple enemies of different sizes during combat. Or you could be driving the Regalia down the highway, or riding chocobos through the forest. One of the developers’ goals was “to create a camera system that would guarantee quality in any situation,” which even in a far simpler game is a tall order.\nPart of that involved tweaking the environment design to better accommodate the camera. “To get rid of any element that might have caused difficulty in exploration and battles, we adjusted background modeling and camera collision countless times while staff worked on the environment,” he said. “Even if props and background elements looked good as a part of a landscape, we adjusted and changed placements of any object without hesitation if it created stress during battle.” That type of deliberate, manual attention is important, he noted.\n“The camera is designed upon the premise that, at its basis, it belongs to the player.” - Hidemi Mizoguchi, Square Enix\nFFXV straddles a weird line between an action and a role-playing game. You have full control during some battles. Other times the game moves the camera for you, often to showcase some gargantuan enemy. Mizoguchi said they knew the camera would have to be flexible, so they created basic, core camera code on top of which they could layer whatever additional functionality they needed for a given situation.\n“By having this common functionality, the camera could receive control input by the player and control collision determination, while also making it possible to create cinematic framing for both still and dynamic moments and even blend the two together,” he said. “The camera is designed upon the premise that, at its basis, it belongs to the player.”\nFor all the game’s strengths, and for all this attention to detail, its camera is frequently cited as one of the game’s most problematic elements, by fans on places like Reddit and GameFAQs, as well as by critics on sites like IGN, Polygon, Kotaku, Glixel, and countless others. The developers even attempted to address the camera issues in a day one patch, with debatable results.\nThe problems in this case seem to come down to sheer scope. It’s not just the size of the game, though, it’s any of the issues that developers face in fine-tuning the dozens of invisible factors that can affect the camera at any given point.\n“Getting the battle system in FFXV into its current shape required a long process of trial and error,” Mizoguchi said. “Even after we established a stylish battle in which the player can freely move around in the air, it still took time to adjust the camera so that it would not hinder the action as the places and situations changed. We continued to adjust right up to the time we submitted the master build.”\nThis is all so much more complex than any casual player might guess. And that’s by design. As Mizoguchi put it, “With a well-adjusted camera, players are able to comfortably play a game without noticing that a camera exists.” All the developers interviewed agreed that this is the number one identifier of a great video game camera.\nIt doesn’t take much to throw the camera out of whack -- a fact that, if nothing else, should make us all appreciate the great video game cameras in our lives all the more.\nMike Rougeau is a freelance journalist who lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend and two dogs. \nWATCH: This charity is helping kids through video

This year's competition, which launched in September 2016, tasked young artists in the U.S. with creating a doodle about what they see for the future. \nSEE ALSO: A 10th grader drew this amazing Google Doodle celebrating black culture\nHarrison's winning doodle, which was displayed on Google's homepage Friday, depicts children of various background embracing each other, all with wide smiles in the name of diversity. In the illustration, the children — who are of different races, genders and abilities — also wear identity-coded clothing displaying their non-visible identities, like religious beliefs and sexual orientation.\n\"I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are.\"\nTitled \"A Peaceful Future,\" the doodle earned Harrison a $30,000 college scholarship and a $50,000 technology award for her high school.\n\"My future is a world where we can all learn to love each other despite our religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality,\" Harrison told Google about her design. \"I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are.\"\nHarrison isn't alone in her hopes for a more inclusive future. Social media users have been loving her message and artistic advocacy for inclusion.\nToday's Google Doodle, by 15-year old Sarah Harrison, warmed every corner of my heart. ❤ pic.twitter.com/sgXv73YHoO— Marie Lu (@Marie_Lu) March 31, 2017\n\nGUYS TODAY'S GOOGLE DOODLE IS SO CUTE pic.twitter.com/5jYZabHMok— mabes the gay (@graydragon63) March 31, 2017\n\nBest Google Doodle Ever pic.twitter.com/1mPhjLl1aZ— Kaija Leung (@SmplyKaija) March 31, 2017\n\nThe annual contest, which began nine years ago, allows students in grades K-12 to submit artwork to be featured on Google's homepage. The winner is chosen through public voting after submissions are narrowed down by a panel of noteworthy judges. This year's judges included Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, musician Sia, late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and Pikachu (yes, really).\nHarrison and four national finalists also received a trip to Google's headquarters, a Chromebook, and an Android tablet for coming out on top in their respective age groups. The other finalists will also receive a $5,000 college scholarship.\nMany of the finalists' doodles touched on themes of social change and impact, including sustainability, identity inclusion and endangered species protection. Some much needed hope for the future, from the future.\nWATCH: What film stars really think about Hollywood's diversity issue"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F433996%252F7ac887d0-b3f3-4dfb-85ff-1e4d30a40969.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=f_h5YmCLo34wugJvCWfR56QpEpc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41548%252F2722b5c2-b27c-4dce-a0c4-ade6bae3a442.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=SgkgEUgNzAncmxOQTfGSTpL7CQI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41548%252F2722b5c2-b27c-4dce-a0c4-ade6bae3a442.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=s2ZFISIVJp4BQ5W8TalsHJrAHS8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41548%252F2722b5c2-b27c-4dce-a0c4-ade6bae3a442.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=7Oy0AX_Ak3Ie-kx1TuuZhOMd7FM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41548%252F2722b5c2-b27c-4dce-a0c4-ade6bae3a442.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=TYwzFilbm0xssWhcC2_Br1scYA0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41548%252F2722b5c2-b27c-4dce-a0c4-ade6bae3a442.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=W8Rh3ejS8dlZn-P-jtvJH3hhcRQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F433996%252F7ac887d0-b3f3-4dfb-85ff-1e4d30a40969.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F433996%252F7ac887d0-b3f3-4dfb-85ff-1e4d30a40969.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F433996%252F7ac887d0-b3f3-4dfb-85ff-1e4d30a40969.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Jc8HCwSkD9oyaEwXL1IHLFnURVw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F433996%252F7ac887d0-b3f3-4dfb-85ff-1e4d30a40969.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=TZlSA5bV7FFFU7PjgzS3iovgj2g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  SARAH HARRISON / GOOGLE"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"The teens will save us all.

London, then you might be aware that the air is slowly poisoning you.\nSEE ALSO: China's big, beautiful, green 'vertical forests' will suck up toxic smog\nOne of the biggest contributors to toxic emissions are vehicles. So an Indian startup is approaching the problem from the rear end. Literally.\nIt blocks diesel emissions at the point of contact with the atmosphere, recycles the leftover carbon and uses it to make art.\n\nGraviky Labs has developed a device called Kaalink which attaches to diesel exhaust pipes and can capture up to 95 percent of carbon soot, stopping it from entering the atmosphere. \nThe soot is then recycled into ink and transformed into marker pens, called Air-Ink.\n\nAccording to Graviky Labs co-founder Anirudh Sharma, the simple plugin tech could provide up to 30 trillion litres of cleaner air for Londoners annually. And a whole load of pens – one pen is filled with ink extracted from approximately 50 minutes of diesel car pollution.\nIt's not the first time they have used the ink to paint a powerful picture about the issue in polluted cities. Previously, they teamed up with street artists in Hong Kong to paint the street with its condensed polluted air. \n\nNow they're in London hosting the world's first Clean Art Gallery in Brixton. The pop-up exhibition features five artists from the UK's most polluted cities. Coincidently, Brixton has already surpassed its 2017 air pollution limit. And it's not even halfway through the year. \n\nThe pop-up exhibition coincides with what is described as a 'unique' clean air initiative unveiled by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Khan, working alongside Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, wants to introduce restrictions on vehicle emissions and upgrades on public transport, urging a swift shift to tackle a pressing problem. Clearing the air we breathe, they say, is an urgent priority that requires transforming how cities flow. \nPleased to announce my latest initiative to clean up London's air. Our online cleaner vehicle checker is a world first of it's kind. pic.twitter.com/WBpUrEmVns— Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) March 29, 2017\n\nFor Sharma, too, that is the main priority. Creating art using his soot-capturing technology is just one side of the coin. He is now looking to collaborate with other disciplines, and with people like London's Mayor, to scale up the technology and make a larger-scale impact.\nOne of most important developments for Air-Ink is improving its quality so that it's suitable for printing. For the moment, though, turning air pollution into safe and rather decent art supplies is no small feat.\n\nWATCH: These artists are painting with ink made from air pollution"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F430830%252F53e461ac-52d4-4143-a1ed-930f3b5b2af5.JPG%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.JPG?signature=X7vbX91llYio0SHf0IOBJztvuhU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41227%252Fafee676e-f4ac-4089-b1f9-20a565b8a00c.JPG%252F1438x0.JPG?signature=J6XRzN9X4Ga_RiK3RyLhi2WbjEQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41227%252Fafee676e-f4ac-4089-b1f9-20a565b8a00c.JPG%252F356x205.JPG?signature=wW9uTcHfdztjj8sv2Up0pIRImcg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41227%252Fafee676e-f4ac-4089-b1f9-20a565b8a00c.JPG%252F712x410.JPG?signature=XZKLe5CyjfQ2t20-MQjRvrkGags=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41227%252Fafee676e-f4ac-4089-b1f9-20a565b8a00c.JPG%252F280x157.JPG?signature=daAoZLmLTQ69ClXLslS9bhYzaKA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F41227%252Fafee676e-f4ac-4089-b1f9-20a565b8a00c.JPG%252F560x314.JPG?signature=0dPHC8PlGHSxn38kL0_QInzQEVw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Roaring street art inked with air pollution.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F430830%252F53e461ac-52d4-4143-a1ed-930f3b5b2af5.JPG%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.JPG","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F430830%252F53e461ac-52d4-4143-a1ed-930f3b5b2af5.JPG%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.JPG","micro":1},"src_type":"jpeg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F430830%252F53e461ac-52d4-4143-a1ed-930f3b5b2af5.JPG%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.JPG?signature=LCH4cpeUp0xuPLx_NkbtwkJHboM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F430830%252F53e461ac-52d4-4143-a1ed-930f3b5b2af5.JPG%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.JPG?signature=thlSTodOv5q2SqGfF4sm8s5tbJM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Roaring street art inked with air pollution."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  John Sanders"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Pop-up exhibition turns poisoned air into ink to send a powerful message","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"rfAoo7vQ","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Carbon soot into ink.
